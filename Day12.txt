Knowledge Representation and Propositional Logic

Knowledge - based agent

  -Inference engine ---> Domain-independent algorithms
  -Knowledge base ----> Domain-specific content

  Knowledge Base (KB):
    Knowledge (a set of sentences) that describe facts about the world in
    some formal (representational) language

    Domain Specific

  Inference Engine
    A set of procedures that use the representational language to infer new
    facts from known ones or answer a variety of KB queries

    Domain independent

Example: MYCIN

  MYCIN : an expert system for diagnosis of bacterial infections

  Knowledge Base represents
    -Facts about a specific patient case
    -Rules describing relations between entities in bacterial infection domain

  Inference engine:
    Manipulates the facts and known relations to answer diagnostic queries


Knowledge representation
    Objective: express the knowledge about the world in a computer-tractable form

Knowledge representation languages (KRLs)
  Syntax: describes how sentences in KRL are formed in language
  Semantics: describes the meaning of sentences what is it the sentence refers
  to in the real world
  Computational aspect: describes how sentences and objects in KRL are
  manipulated in concordance with semantic conventions

Logic is a formal language for expressing knowledge and for making logical inferences
which is defined by
  A set of sentences: A sentence is constructed from a set of primitives according to
  syntactic rules
  A set of interpretations: An interpretation I gives a semantic to primitives.
  It associates primitives with objects or values

The valuation (meaning) function V:
  Assigns a value (typically the truth value) to a given sentence under some
  interpretation

Propositional Logic - the simplest logic

  A proposition is a statement that is either true or false

Semantics: Propositional symbols
  The meaning (value) of the propositional symbol for a specific
  interpretation is given by its interpretation

I: Light in the room is on -> True. It rains outside -> False
  V(Light in the room is on, I) = True
  V(It rains outside, I) =False

Contradiction and Tautology

Composite sentences may always (under any interpretation) evaluate to a
single truth value

Contradiction (Always False)
  P and not P

Tautology (Always True)
  P or not P

Model Validity and Satisfiability
  An interpretation is a model for a set of sentences if it assigns true
  to each sentence in the set.
  A sentence is satisfiable if it has a model
    There is at least one interpretation under which the sentence can
    evaluate to True
