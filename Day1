Solving Problems Using Search
--------------------------------


Several possible solutions ==> search

Examples:

 Traveler Problem
 ================
  Optimize: Find the minimum length between two points

Definitions:
  Search space:
    The set of objects among which are searched for the solution
  Goal Condition:
    Condition to weed out solutions in the possible search space

Efficiency of search:
  The search space and its size
  Method used to explore (traverse) the search space
  Condition to test the satisfaction of the search objective
  (what it takes to determine the target solution)

Graph Search Problem
  -States
    Game positions, locations on the that are represented by nodes in the
    graph
  -Operators
    Valid moves
  -Initial State
    Start position, start city
  -Goal state
    Target position (positions), target city (cities)
  -Type of the problem
  -Possible solution cost
