Introduction to First Order Logic
----------------------------------

Propositional logic is Not as powerful as natural human languages, such
as English, Spanish

First - Order logic (FOL)
  Whereas propositional logic assumes world contains facts,
  first-order logic (like natural language) assumes the world contains
    -Objects: people, houses, numbers, games, wars
    -Relations: red, round, bogus, prime
    -Functions: father of, best friend of , third inning of

Syntax of FOL: Basic elements

  Constants
  Predicates
  Functions
  Variables
  Connectives
  Equality
  Quantifiers


An atomic sentence (also called an atom) is formed from a predicate symbol
optionally followed by a parenthesized list of terms:
  Atomic sentence = predicate (term1, ...term n) or
                    term1= term2
  term = function(term1, ... term n)
    or constant or variable

Truth in First-Order logic
  Sentences are true with respect to a model and an interpretation

  Model contains >= 1 objects (domain elements) and relations among them

  Interpretation specifies referents for
    Constant symbols -> objects
    Predicate symbols -> relations
    Function symbols -> functional relations

An atomic sentence predicate (term1, ...term n) is true
iff the objects referred to by term1,...term n
are in the relation referred to by predicate

Models for FOL: Lots!
  Entailment in propositional logic can be computed by enumerating models
  We can enumerate the FOL models for a given KB vocabulary

For each number of domain elements n from 1 to infinity
  For each k-ary predicate Pk in the vocabulary
    For each possible k-ary relation on n objects
      For each constant symbol C in the vocabulary
        For each choice of referent for C from n objects

Universal Quantification
  All  ∀ (variables) (sentence)
  \ this symbol is the upside down A looking character

  Important to remember to use the imply symbol not the and symbol
  This is signified in the importance between
    "Everyone at Mines in smart."
            and
    "Everyone is at Mines and everyone is smart"

Existential Quantification
    ∃x At(x, Stanford) ^ Smart (x)

    This translates to "Someone at Stanford is smart."

Properties of Quantifiers - Not communicative
    ∃x ∀y Loves(x, y)
“There is a person who loves everyone in the world”
    ∀y ∃x Loves(x, y)
“Everyone in the world is loved by at least one person”

Equality
  term1 = term2 is true under a given interpretation iff
  term1 and term2 refer to the same object

  E.g. ∀ x ×(Sqrt(x),Sqrt(x)) = x are satisfiable
2=2 is valid
