Inference in Propositional Logic

Entailment
  Reflects the relation of one fact in the world following from the others

Inference
  Inference is a process by which new sentences are derived from existing
  sentences in the KB
    The inference process is implemented on a computer

    Assume an inference procedure i that derives a sentence alpha from the KB:
    KB |- i alpha

Logical Inference Problem
  Given a knowledge base KB(a set of sentences) and
  a sentence alpha (called a theorem)

Does a KB semantically entail alpha?
  In other words: In all interpretations in which sentences in the KB are true,
  is alpha also true?

Question: Is there a procedure (program) that can decide this problem in
a finite number of steps?

Answer: Yes. Logical inference problem for the propositional logic is decidable

  What are the tactics to answer a logical inference problem?
    -Truth table
    -Inference rules
    -Conversion to the inverse SAT problem

Truth table approach
  1. Generate table for all possible interpretations
  2. Check whether the sentence alpha evaluates to true whenever KB
  evaluates to true

What is the computational complexity of this truth table approach?

Exponential in the number of the propositional symbols
  2^n Rows in the table has to be filled

The truth table is exponential in the number of propositional symbols

This can be made more efficient
