Informed Search Methods
----------------------

Incorporate more than the problem definition like the chance or potential
for a specific goal to be reached.

A heuristic measures the potential for a node to reach a goal

  Usually a heuristic is denoted by h(n)

Evaluation - function driven search
------------------------------------

-A Search strategy can be defined in terms of a node evaluation
function
 f(n)
 Find how much the a given node should be expanded
(High=good)

A* Search
----------
-uses the evaluation function to determine total cost of node n to
the goal
  f(n)=g(n) +h(n)

  g(n) cost so far to reach n (path cost)
  h(n) estimated cost from n to goal (heuristic)

Why are heuristics good if they only provide guesses?
  -If only a uniform cost search where used without a heuristic
  then nodes that are opposite of the goal but >= dist of another node
  would still be explored. Basically, prevents a search algorithm
  from exploring node A in the illustration below

    A             O             B           GOAL

  This makes the search algorithm more focused on finding the optimal
  path

Properties
-
  Complete?
    Yes, unless there are infinitely many nodes f< f(G) (start to node cost
    less than the goal node's cost)
  Optimal?
    Yes -it cannot expand f(i+1) and fi is finished
  Time?
    Exponential-Number of nodes for which f(n)<=C* (relative error
    in h x the length of solution)
  Space?
    Exponential-keeps all nodes in memory

Weighted A* Search
------------------
  -Inflate an admissible heuristic by multiplying a > 1 and then
  performing A* search
  -Fewer nodes will be expanded, but the resulting solution may be
  suboptimal
