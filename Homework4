Question1 :
  Inference with Propositional Logic
  -----------------------------------

    -Are there inference algorithms for propositional logic that are sound and complete?
      Definition of soundness:
        An argument is sound iff
          The argument is valid
          All of its premises are true

          All men are mortal
          Socrates is a man
          Therefore, Socrates is mortal
          
      Definition of Completeness:


    -If you answered yes for the above question, what aspects of propositional logic make it
    possible to have such algorithms? If you answered no, what aspects of propositional logic
    make it impossible to have such algorithms?
