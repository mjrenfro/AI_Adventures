Local Search Part II
-------------------------

Beyond Classic search
  -Too much memory being used!

If only finding the goal matters (not necessarily the path), then local search
algorithms can be used

Stores only the current node
Moves only to neighbors of that node
Typically the paths followed by the search are not retained

Hill climbing often get stuck for the following reasons:
  local maxima
  plateaux --flat local maxima, shoulder
  Ridge

Solutions
  1. Sideways move for hill-climbing algorithm
  2. Stochastic hill climbing: Chooses at random from among the uphill moves
  3. First-choice hill climbing: implements stochastic hill climbing by
  generating successors randomly until one is generated than the current state
  4. Random-restart hill climbing: it conducts a series of hill-climbing searches
  from randomly generated initial states, until a goal is found



Hill-climbing search (greedy)
  Complete/optimal
    No -- can get in local optima

Simulated Annealing
  -An alternative solution to the local optima problem
  -Permits "bad" moves to states with a lower value--avoids being
  stuck in local optima!

Examples:
  -ping-pong ball
  -cooling metal

pseudocode:
  -Initialize current to starting state
  -For i = 1 to infinity
    -If T(i)=0 return current
    -Let next = random successor of current
    -Let delta=value(next) - value(current)
    -if delta > 0 then let current=next
    -Else let current = next with probability exp(delta/T(i))

Effect of temperature

The probability decreases as the "temperature" T goes down

-"Bad" moves are more likely to be allowed at the start when T is high,
-And they become more unlikely as T decreases

Local Beam Search
-----------------
  -Start with k randomly generated states
  -At each iteration, all the successors of all k states
  are generated
  -If any one is a goal state, stop. Otherwise select the k best successors from
  the complete list and repeat

Genetic Search

  -Initial population
  -Fitness function
  -Selection
  -Crossover
  -Mutation
